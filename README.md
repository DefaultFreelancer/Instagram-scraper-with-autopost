# Instagram-scraper-with-autopost

Instagram scraper which scrapes peoples images use machine learning to recognise a face, if face
is detected it will repost that photo.

Script now saves user session and and have CLI session. 
I also integrated it with instabot api.
90% of it are junk code I will fix it later.

This script scrapes images from users and then repost them under your Instagram accounts with your own tags.

git clone https://github.com/reliefs/Instagram-scraper-with-autopost.git

cd Instagram-scraper-with-autopost

sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
